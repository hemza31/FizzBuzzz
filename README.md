FizzBuzz
========


Description
-----------

Create a file called “fizzbuzz.js”, which logs the numbers from  **1 to 100** to
the console, but for multiples of three (5), log the word “Fizz” instead of the
number, and for multiples of five (7) log “Buzz”, and for numbers which are 
multiples of both three and five, log “FizzBuzz”.
It would look like this:

```
1
2
3
4
fizz
6
buzz
8
9
fizz
11
12
13
buzz
fizz
16
17
18
19
fizz
...
```
